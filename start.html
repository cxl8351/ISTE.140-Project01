        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Nintendo was founded as Nintendo Karuta[d] on 23 September 1889[7] by craftsman Fusajiro Yamauchi in Shimogyō-ku, Kyoto, Japan, to produce and distribute hanafuda (花札, "flower cards"),[1][4][8] a type of traditional Japanese playing card. The name 'Nintendo' is commonly assumed to mean "leave luck to heaven",[9][8] but the assumption lacks historical validation; it can alternatively be translated as "the temple of free hanafuda".[10] With the increase of the cards' popularity, Yamauchi hired assistants to mass-produce to satisfy the demand.[11] Even with a favorable start, the company faced financial struggle due to operating in a niche market, the slow and expensive manufacturing process, high product price, alongside long durability of the cards, which impacted sales due to the low replacement rate.[12] As a solution, Nintendo produced a cheaper and lower-quality line of playing cards, Tengu, while also conducting product offerings in other cities such as Osaka, where card game profits were high. In addition, local merchants were interested in the prospect of a continuous renewal of decks, thus avoiding the suspicions that reusing cards would generate.[13]</p>
        <p>According to data from Nintendo, the company's first western-style card deck was put on the market in 1902,[3] although other documents postpone the date to 1907, shortly after the Russo-Japanese War.[14] The war created considerable difficulties for companies in the leisure sector, which were subject to new levies such as the Karuta Zei ("playing cards tax").[15] Nintendo subsisted and, in 1907, entered into an agreement with Nihon Senbai—later known as the Japan Tobacco—to market its cards to various cigarette stores throughout the country.[16] A promotional calendar distributed by Nintendo from the Taishō era dated to 1915 was found, indicating that the company was named 'Yamauchi Nintendo', and used the Marufuku Nintendo Co. brand for its playing cards.[17]</p>
        <p>Japanese culture stipulated that for Nintendo Koppai to continue as a family business after Yamauchi's retirement, Yamauchi had to adopt his son-in-law so that he could take over the business. As a result, Sekiryo Kaneda adopted the Yamauchi surname in 1907 and became the second president of Nintendo Koppai in 1929. By that time, Nintendo Koppai was the largest card game company in Japan.[18]</p>

        <h2>Controversies</h2>
        <h3>#FreeSmash</h3>
        <p>The Big House is one of the most well-known Super Smash Bros Melee tournaments in the world. In October 2020, they announced that that year’s event (in December) would have to take place online.</p>
        <p>Going online was only possible thanks to Slippi Online, a custom emulator that allows you to play Melee (and other old Nintendo titles) with other people, even if you aren’t sitting right next to each other.</p>
        <p>Melee fans were relieved that the global crisis didn’t cancel their beloved event—that is, until The Big House received a cease-and-desist from Nintendo for using “illegally copied versions” of Melee.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t long until this move sparked the #FreeMelee and #FreeSmash hashtags that trended worldwide on social media. This wasn’t first time Nintendo shut down an event like this, but it was the last straw for a lot of fans of the Smash franchise.</p>
        <p>You have to remember: Super Smash Bros Melee is 20 years old now, and Nintendo has made no move to port it to newer consoles. There’s no other legal way to play the game over the internet.</p>
        <p>Without a viable alternative method, many fans feel like this was an unnecessarily harsh move with no real benefit for Nintendo—especially as the cease-and-desist came just weeks before the event.</p>


        <h3>Mario Movie</h3>
        <p>On Sept. 23, Nintendo announced via its online presentation Nintendo Direct that it will be releasing a new animated Super Mario movie in 2022 with Illumination Studios. The cast includes “The Queen’s Gambit” star Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, and comedian Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Who gets to play the lead role of Mario? Perhaps, Danny Devito — with his scratchy New Jersey Italian accent — snatched the role? Or maybe the honor is bestowed upon comedian T.J. Miller, who led the equally star-studded ensemble of the “The Emoji Movie?” These were just a few of the possibilities floating around the internet.

            Unfortunately for Nintendo pundits, however, the answer is Chris Pratt.
            
            To be fair, Pratt is an excellent actor, garnering much love from fans for his roles as Star-Lord in “Guardians of the Galaxy” and Emmet in “The Lego Movie.” However, he seems out of place in the ostensibly comedy-heavy cast given his recent action roles. Alongside personalities such as Rogen, Jack Black, and Charlie Day, Pratt possesses the least comedic presence, which should not be the case for the lead role in any star-studded movie. He’s not even Italian. Even Ryan Reynolds, frankly, would have made a better choice.</p>

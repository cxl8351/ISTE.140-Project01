                hanafuda playing cards. After venturing into various lines of business during the 1960s and acquiring a legal status as a 
                public company under the current company name, Nintendo distributed its first video game console, the Color TV-Game, in 
                1977. It gained international recognition with the release of Donkey Kong in 1981 and the Nintendo Entertainment System
